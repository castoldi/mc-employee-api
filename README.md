## Generate HTTPS Certificates
Below commands were used to generate non-production self-signed certificates.

```shell
keytool -genkeypair -alias mc-employee-api -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -storetype JKS -keystore mc-employee-api.jks -validity 3650 -storepass changeit
keytool -genkeypair -alias mc-employee-api -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -storetype PKCS12 -keystore mc-employee-api.p12 -validity 3650 -storepass changeit
```

Should you have a signed JKS, use this command to convert to PKCS12:

```shell
keytool -import -alias mc-employee-api -file myCertificate.crt -keystore mc-employee-api.p12 -storepass changeit
```
