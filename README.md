## Generate new certificates
Use below commands to generate non-production certificates.

```sh
keytool -genkeypair -alias mc-employee-api -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -storetype JKS -keystore mc-employee-api.jks -validity 3650 -storepass changeit
keytool -genkeypair -alias mc-employee-api -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -storetype PKCS12 -keystore mc-employee-api.p12 -validity 3650 -storepass changeit
